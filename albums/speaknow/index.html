<h1>Speaknow</h1>
<p>
    Speak Now is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 25, 2010, through Big Machine Records. Swift wrote the album in a two-year period while she was promoting her second studio album Fearless (2008). She developed Speak Now as a loose concept album about the confessions she wanted to make to people she had met but never had a chance to.

    Much of Speak Now, which was inspired by Swift's growth into adulthood, is about love and heartbreak. Swift abandoned the youthful optimism of Fearless for introspection. Swift and Nathan Chapman produced Speak Now, a country pop, power pop, and pop rock album. Its songs incorporate styles including bluegrass, pop punk, arena rock, and goth rock. The melodies are characterized by acoustic instruments with dynamic electric guitars, string instruments, and drums.

    After the album's release, Swift embarked on the Speak Now World Tour, which visited Asia, Europe, North America, and Australasia from February 2011 to March 2012. Six singles supported the album; "Mine" and "Back to December" reached the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100; and "Sparks Fly" and "Ours" topped the US Hot Country Songs chart. Speak Now peaked at number one on charts, and received multi-platinum certifications in Australia (double platinum) and Canada (triple platinum). In the United States, it spent six weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 and was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
