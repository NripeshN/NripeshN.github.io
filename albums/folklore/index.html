<h1>Folklore</h1>
<p>
    Folklore (stylized in all lowercase) is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album, released on July 24, 2020, via Republic Records. After the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Swift cancelled her planned sixth concert tour, Lover Fest, and quarantined herself, during when she conceived Folklore as "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness" out of her imagination.

    Swift collaborated with producers Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually; she recorded her vocals at a home studio she built in a bedroom of her Los Angeles residence, while Dessner and Antonoff worked from Hudson Valley and New York City, respectively. Departing from the mainly upbeat pop production of its predecessors, Folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by neo-classical instruments, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock, and electroacoustic styles. Influenced by loneliness during the quarantine, Swift explores themes of escapism, empathy, romanticism and nostalgia in the album, through a set of characters, fictional narratives and story arcs, in contrast to the autobiographical tone of her previous projects. The title was inspired by her desire for the music to have a lasting legacy akin to folk songs, whereas its artworks and aesthetic reflect cottagecore.

    Upon release, Folklore broke the Guinness World Record for the biggest opening day on Spotify for an album by a female act.[note 1] Three of its tracks reached the top 10 of the record charts in eight countries, namely "Cardigan", "The 1" and "Exile", the first of which is the album's lead single and marked Swift's sixth number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100. Folklore topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and various other countries. It was Swift's seventh consecutive number-one album on the US Billboard 200, where it reigned atop for eight weeks and became the best-selling album of 2020.
