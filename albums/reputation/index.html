<h1>Reputation</h1>
<p>
    Reputation (stylized in all lowercase) is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on November 10, 2017, by Big Machine Records. Swift became a subject of rampant tabloid scrutiny following the release of her fifth studio album 1989 (2014), with the media outlets highly publicizing her personal life and her disputes with other celebrities. She hence secluded herself from the press and social media, where she had maintained an active presence, and created Reputation as an effort to revamp her state of mind.

    Influenced by the commotion, Swift wrote Reputation under two major themes; one drawing from the excessive gossips surrounding her, and the other about finding love amidst the tumultuous events. She recruited producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, and Shellback in the album's production. Marking a stark shift from the synth-pop style of its predecessor, Reputation is built around dark electropop and R&B, inspired by urban genres such as EDM, hip hop, trap, and Miami bass, resulting in a heavy electronic production consisting of surging synthesizers, pulsing drum machines, and manipulated vocals. In retrospect, Swift has described Reputation as a "defense mechanism" and an alter ego.

    To coordinate with the album's motifs, Swift did not promote Reputation through press interviews, unlike her previous efforts. Four international singles—"Look What You Made Me Do", "...Ready for It?", "End Game", and "Delicate"—supported the album; they peaked at number one, four, eighteen and twelve on the Billboard Hot 100. "Gorgeous" and "Call It What You Want" preceded the album as promotional tracks, while "New Year's Day" was serviced to US country radio and "Getaway Car" to Australian radio. Critical response to Reputation was generally positive; reviewers were divided on the brash sound and harsh themes, but praised Swift's resilient songwriting, specifically on the songs about romantic intimacy. Some critics felt the album is a personal record in which Swift becomes vulnerable to a sincere lover and discovers her inner self.

    The album was Swift's fourth consecutive album to debut atop the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over 1.2 million copies, and reached number one in various countries, including Australia, Canada, and the UK. Selling over 4.5 million copies in 2017, Reputation became the world's best selling album by a female artist. It was supported by the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), which became the highest-grossing North American tour of all time. Reputation was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, listed on Slant Magazine's list of the best albums of the 2010s decade, and has received sales certifications across the globe. Swift cleared out her website and social media accounts five days before announcing Reputation, generating widespread attention across the internet; various artists have since used this tactic to announce new music.
