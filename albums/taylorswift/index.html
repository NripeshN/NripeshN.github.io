<p>
    Taylor Swift is the self-titled debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released through Big Machine Records in the US and Canada on October 24, 2006, and internationally on March 18, 2008. Swift had relocated from Pennsylvania to Tennessee in 2004, at fourteen years old, to pursue a career as a country singer-songwriter. She signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, and Big Machine Records in 2005, to work on her debut album during her first high school year.

    Of the eleven songs that made to the album, Swift has sole writing credits on three, and co-writing credits on the remaining with Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, Angelo Petraglia, and Liz Rose. The album was produced by Orrall and Nathan Chapman. The lyrics are about Swift's perspectives of life as a teenager, dealing with romantic relationships, friendships, and insecurity. Taylor Swift is primarily a country record with pop and pop rock elements, incorporating acoustic instruments such as guitars, banjos, and fiddles. Five singles supported Taylor Swift, including the Hot Country Songs number-ones "Our Song" and "Should've Said No", and Swift's first top-15 entry on the Billboard Hot 100, "Teardrops on My Guitar". Swift promoted the album by interacting with her audiences through MySpace, embarking on a six-month radio tour in 2006, and opening tours for other country artists throughout 2006 and 2007.
