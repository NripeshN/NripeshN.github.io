<h1>Lover</h1>
<p>
    Lover is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 23, 2019, via Republic Records. Motivated by her positive experience on her Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), Swift sought to make an album with bright and lighter tones focusing on the foundational strengths of her songcraft, recalibrating from the dark trope of its predecessor, Reputation (2017). Lover is Swift's first album after parting ways with her former label Big Machine Records, which resulted in a highly publicized dispute.

    Swift enlisted producers Jack Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little, and recorded Lover akin to her live performances, emulating concert-based vocals. Described by her as "a love letter to love itself", the lyrical scope of Lover covers all facets of love, ranging from contentment, infatuation, endearment, lust, and heartache, to political themes such as feminism, equality, and disillusionment. Musically, it is a retro-styled pop record, combining dream pop, synth-pop, electropop, and pop rock genres with country, punk, funk, and folk elements, characterized by upbeat arrangements, midtempo rhythms and atmospheric synthesizers. Lover features guest vocals from the Chicks and Brendon Urie, and employs a summer festivity-inspired aesthetic.

    Four singles supported the album: "Me!", "You Need to Calm Down", "Lover", and "The Man", the first three of which reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. All of the album's 18 tracks charted on the Hot 100, breaking the all-time female record for the most simultaneous entries. Lover topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and several others. It was Swift's sixth number-one album on the US Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum. Selling 3.2 million copies in 2019, Lover was the best-selling studio album of the year and made Swift the world's best-selling musician of 2019.
